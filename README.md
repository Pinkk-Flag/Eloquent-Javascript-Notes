# Eloquent-Javascript-Notes
My notes on the book "Eloquent Javascript"

You may feel free to look at my code reuse it, or do anything you wish to do with it it. 

### Why?
After I finished learning Rust (reference my repository where I took notes on the Rust book), I decided to pick up some Javascript. I decided to do it on the book "Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke. All credit goes to him for making this book.
